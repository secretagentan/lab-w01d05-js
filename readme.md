# üìù Todo! 

We're going to practice DOM events and rendering to the DOM
by creating a simple Todo App.

Implement the following tasks: 

# Setup
- [x] Fork and clone this repository
- [x] Create index.html, main.js and style.css files.
- [x] Add your HTML boilerplate and link up your files
- [x] Add an input element with the class "new-todo" to the page
- [x] Add an empty unordered list with the class 'todos'
- [x] Start up a server

### When a user enters text into 'input.new-todo' and hits enter
- [x] render the text as a new 'li'
- [x] the 'li' should contain the value from 'input.new-todo'
- [x] the 'li' should have a class of "todo"
- [x] the 'li' should contain a 'span' with a class of 'remove' and the text content 'x'
- [x] Append the 'li' to 'ul.todos'

### When a user click's on the todo text
- [ ] add or remove the class "complete"
- [ ] "complete" should add a line through the text

### When a user clicks on a todo's span's "x"
- [ ] remove the todo from the DOM

### When a to-do item is added to the list
- [ ] adds to item counter on page (# completed / total items)

### When a to-do item is completed
- [ ] adds to items completed on counter
